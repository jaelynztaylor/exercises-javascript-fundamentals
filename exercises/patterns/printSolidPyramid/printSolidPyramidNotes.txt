notes on printSolidPyramid

the number of characters goes up in odd numbers
    1 - 1
    2 - 3
    3 - 5
    4 - 7
    5 - 9
    6 - 11
to make it centered, there's one space on each side 

first trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numChars = i*2-1;

    helpers.printCountTimes([' ','#', numChars, ' ']);
    helpers.printNewLine();
  }

results:
    it printed nothing lol. i think my print statement is just a bit complicated

what i want to do:
    the number of characters is just 2n-1
    i want to create an array that as the spaces at the beginning and ending

realization: this is more complex than i originally thought
    the array thing won't work because the number of spaces is not consistent
    **created grid in notebook that shows this

realization 2: 
    as the number of characters increases by every odd number (2n-1),
    the number of spaces is decreasing by every even number

second trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numSpaces = 2*i-2;
    let numChars = 2*i-1;

    helpers.printCountTimes(' ', numSpaces);
    helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
    helpers.printNewLine();
  }

results:
    it's printing the right number of spaces and characters
    the spaces are just all in the beginning so it prints slanted
    instead of centered

    need to find a way to 
        a. inverse the number of spaces (see notebook)
        b. get it to split the number of spaces (which is an even number)
        evenly on both sides of the characters
            b is as easy as printing numSpaces/2, twice

third trial code:
 for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numSpaces = 2*i-2;
    let numChars = 2*i-1;

    helpers.printCountTimes(' ', (numSpaces/2));
    helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
    helpers.printCountTimes(' ', (numSpaces/2));
    helpers.printNewLine();
  }

results: 
    okay that did the trick as far as halving the number of spaces on both sides
    still not centered tho lol

sidenote:
if this exercise was to print an obtuse triangle, i fucking killed it

thoughts:
    do i need to start a different counter backwards?? 

AHA I GOT IT (i hope)
    number of spaces= (2*height)-(2*i)

aaaaaand i did it!
