notes on printSolidRightTriangle

first trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numCharsSpace = height - 1;
    let numChars = height - numCharsSpace

    helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
    helpers.printNewLine();
    helpers.printCountTimes(' ', numCharsSpace);
    helpers.printNewLine();

results: 
    printed one character on one line 
    printed one space after the one character 
    continuted for a number of lines defined by height 

second trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numCharsSpace = height - 1;
    let numChars = height - numCharsSpace

    helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
    helpers.printNewLine();

results:
    same as the first trial, minus the printed spaces in between character lines

third trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    let numChars = height - 1

    helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
    helpers.printNewLine();

predictions: won't work for height = 1, would print a solid square
for every other number that's just height-1
    prediction was right expect it did print for 1? i think it's because
    of the counter set at i=0

what am i missing:
    i need a way to tell the code to type a certain number of spaces
    and then the character

fourth trial code:
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
  let numCharsSpace = height - 1;
  let numChars = height - numCharsSpace

  helpers.printCountTimes('#', numChars);
  helpers.printCountTimes(' ', numCharsSpace);
  helpers.printNewLine();

results:
    got rid of the extra space that was between the characters 
    in the first trial

    now, i need to introduce a counter that will have it increase 
    by 1 for each suquential line

    create a new variable called line number?

i feel like i'm overcomplicating this tbh
    do i really need to have another variable for the number
    of spaces
    it doesn't even matter how many spaces I put in because
    you wouldn't even be able to see it
    ugh i'm fucking up i think. time to rethink

OKAY REALLY GOOD THOUGHT: WHAT IF I JUST DEFINED THIS IN TERMS
OF i INSTEAD OF THE HEIGHT AAAAAAHHHH THAT MIGHT DO IT

lol yep that did it.
