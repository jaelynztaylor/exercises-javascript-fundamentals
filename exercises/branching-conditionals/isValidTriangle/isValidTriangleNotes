notes on isValidTriangle

so in class, Jesse basically showed us the methodology behind 
solving the problem

triangles depend on three conditions, given 3 side lengths a,b,class 
    a+b>c
    b+c>a
    c+a>b

didn't copy and paste my trial codes like i normally do but
worked on this for like 30min
    went into it thinking it would be a quick plug and chug
    with the different conditions set as if statements

    kept running into error messages

    realized that i would need to set up conditionals
    depending on which side length is the largest in the set

    ended up with like 10 branches and still getting error messages

went and looked at other people's code! Will, specifically
    shocked by how simple it was
    messaged him on Slack to see if he could explain this bit:
        let [x,y,z] = [a,b,c].sort();

        return z < x + y;

got an explanation, he walked me through how he got there and the
feedback Jesse had given him
    very similar to my original code of 10 branches and a ton 
    of conditionals

voila! code.
